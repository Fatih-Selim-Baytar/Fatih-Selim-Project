# Fatih-Selim-Project
As a highly skilled software developer with a strong background in project management, I am dedicated to creating cutting-edge solutions for a variety of clients and industries. With over 2 years of experience in the field, I have a deep understanding of the software development lifecycle and am well-versed in a variety of programming languages, including Python.

I began my career as a junior developer, working on small projects and learning the basics of software development. As I gained experience, I took on larger and more complex projects, honing my skills and building my knowledge of the industry. Along the way, I also developed a strong interest in project management, and began to take on more leadership roles on my teams.

In my current role as a senior developer, I lead teams of developers and work closely with clients to ensure that their needs are met and their projects are delivered on time and within budget. I am highly organized and efficient, and have a proven track record of delivering high-quality software on schedule.

In addition to my technical skills, I am also a strong communicator and team player. I am able to explain complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders and build positive relationships with clients and team members alike.

I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer and a project manager, and am excited to continue to make a positive impact in the industry.
